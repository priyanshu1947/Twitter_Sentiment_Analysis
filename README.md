# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning project that aims to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of tweets. In this project, we use natural language processing techniques to analyze and classify tweets based on their content.

**Project Overview**

  The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project consists of the following components:

**Dataset**

    We use a large dataset of labeled tweets (positive or negative) for training and testing our model. The dataset contains millions of tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels.
    
**Preprocessing:**

  We preprocess the raw text data by removing stopwords, stemming words, and converting text to numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization.
  
**Model Training:**

  We train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data. Logistic regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification tasks.
  
**Model Evaluation:**

  We evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on both training and test data using accuracy as the evaluation metric.
  
**Model Deployment:**

  We save the trained model to a file (trained_model.sav) for future use.

# How to Use This Project

**Clone the Repository:**

  Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.
  
**Install Dependencies:** 

  Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required libraries using the following command:
  
**pip install -r requirements.txt**

**Dataset**

  The dataset used for this project is the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle. It contains 1.6 million tweets labeled with 0 (negative) or 4 (positive).

**Data Processing**

    Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
    Preprocess the data by replacing target values and handling missing values.
    Apply text preprocessing techniques, including stemming and removing stopwords.
    Split the data into training and testing sets.

**Model Training**

    Use TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
    Train a logistic regression model on the training data.
    
**Model Evaluation**

    Evaluate the model's accuracy on both the training and testing sets.
    
**Model Deployment**

    Save the trained model using the pickle library.
    Demonstrate how to load the model for future predictions.

**Run the Model:**

  Load the trained model from trained_model.sav and use it to predict the sentiment of new tweets. You can modify the code to analyze custom tweets or real-time data.
  
**Create Your Own Dataset:**

  If you want to create your own labeled dataset for sentiment analysis, collect tweets related to a specific topic (e.g., movie reviews, product feedback) and manually label them as positive or negative.
